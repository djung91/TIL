## Internationalization

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms **i18n** 
(where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word internationalization, 
a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s) 
and **L10n** for localization, due to the length of the words.
